### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a game developer with a variety of skills and projects under my belt. I'm comfy with Unreal, Unity, C# and C++. 

I have an "I'll figure it out" attitude and apply it to everything in my life. I'm not afraid of new challenges and I think this attitude enables that!

Some of my projects are public and pinned, some of my personal game project repos are private.. hope you understand. If you're interested in them, please email me!
